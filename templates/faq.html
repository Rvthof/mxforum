        True, we based this forum on sites like <a href=http://www.stackoverflow.com>stackoverflow</a> and <a href=http://www.uservoice.com.>uservoice</a>. Were older forums are controlled by assigned moderators we really like the idea that the most prominent users, who gained <span class="yellowbg">reputation</span> by contributing valuable content, can have certain privileges to keep this forum clean. In other words, this forum is run by you. <br>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Reputation?</h3>
        For basic use of our forum, you do not need any reputation, asking questions, answering questions and simply viewing questions can be done by everyone.
        <br><br>
		But if you want to help running the site, you’ll need reputation. The more reputation you gain by contributing, the more we allow you to change and adjust content. 
        <br><br>
        Reputation can be gained if your questions or helpful answers are voted up by other members. For every upvote, you gain 10 reputation points. But if you ask off topic questions or answers than you might be voted down: this means you lose 2 reputation points.  You can only earn 200 reputation points a day. Any vote for posts that are marked “community wiki” cannot result in gaining reputation.
		<br><br>
		These are the amounts of reputation you need to have certain options:
